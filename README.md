# MLOps_Jan_Mollet
This will be Jan Mollet's Repository for all the labs and projects during MLOps Spring 2026.

Find the First Lab where I decided to use the wine dataset to predict three different types of wines based on:

  - Flavanoids: one of the most essential substances in the formation of color, flavor and most health properties.
  - Color Intensity: gradient sclae of colors for the wine
  - Proline:  is an amino acid naturally found in grapes that has recently been shown to boost viscosity, sweetness and flavour of red wine

1. I prepared and trained the model using FastAPI as a backend.
2. I used Streamlit as a FrontEnd for the user to be able to input data or load a json file.
